# cemd_metasurf
Coupled electric and magnetic dipole (CEMD) librery for calculating optical properties of metasurfaces.

### Installation
```
pip install cemd-metasurf
```

The current version can calculate reflexion and transmision for lattices with one particle per unit cell. In future releases it is planning to add new functionalities as:

- More than one particles per unit cell.
- Near field calculation (with periodicity along the lattice).
- Local density of states and near field for dipole exitation.
- Presence of layered ubstrate.
